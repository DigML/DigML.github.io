### **Industry Experience**  
### **Algorithm Engineer (Recommendation Systems)**  
**Xiaohongshu Technology Co., Ltd.** | **User Growth Department**  
**November 2023 – March 2024**  
Designed and implemented machine learning models for user acquisition, retention, and churn recovery. Leveraged PySpark, Hadoop, and PyTorch to build predictive models for LTV, CTCVR, ΔROI, and ARPU metrics, supported by in-depth statistical analysis.  

#### **Key Contributions**:  
- **Innovative Strategy Development**: Pioneered a mirror-based advertising evaluation framework for second-day retention, engagement rate, and efficiency metrics, adopted by multiple departments.  
- **High-Value Audience Segmentation**: Developed a framework to identify high-ROI users from churned populations, achieving significant ROI improvements. Now deployed across all user segments.  
- **Patent-Pending Technologies**: Filed two patents for the advertising evaluation framework and audience segmentation technology.  


### **Algorithm Engineer (Data Intelligence)**  
**AviaGames (North American Gaming Company, $5B Valuation)** | **China R&D Center**  
**September 2023 – November 2023**  
Developed end-to-end machine learning pipelines for revenue forecasting (p-ltv). Built hybrid models combining RNN/LSTM/GRU-based time-series networks and tree-based models to predict 60-day game revenues.  

#### **Key Contributions**:  
- **Pipeline Development**: Constructed scalable forecasting pipelines using Snowflake and SageMaker, ensuring model reproducibility and deployment efficiency.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Conducted user-level error analysis to refine model accuracy, reducing forecasting deviation by 12%.  
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Collaborated with Scrum teams to align algorithm development with product roadmaps.
